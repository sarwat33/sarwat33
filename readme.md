# Hi, I'm Sarwat ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m an **Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student** with a passion for **PCB Design** **development** and **robotics**. I love building things that solve real-world problems, and Iâ€™m currently diving into **ROS 2** to bring my robotics knowledge to life. Iâ€™ve also worked on several interesting projects using **Python**, **PHP**, and **C++**.

## About Me ðŸš€

Iâ€™m an engineering student with a growing interest in **machine learning**, **software development**, and **robotics simulation**. I enjoy solving problems using a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. Iâ€™m currently learning **ROS 2** to apply robotics in real-world applications, but I also have experience in developing **web applications**, **command-line tools**, and **games**. Here are some of the technologies Iâ€™ve worked with:

## Growing Interest in Robotics Simulation ðŸ¤–

Iâ€™m deeply interested in **robotics simulation** using **ROS 2**. As I continue to expand my knowledge, I aspire to create **autonomous robots** capable of complex tasks like **navigation**, **object detection**, and **obstacle avoidance**. I'm working on applying **ROS 2** to robotics, which will help me turn my ideas into practical and fully functioning systems.

My goal is to simulate and control robots in real-world scenarios and bring them into environments like **Gazebo**, allowing me to test algorithms and systems in a fully virtual space.

I believe **robotics** and **automation** will drive future innovations in various industries, and Iâ€™m excited to be a part of that journey. Stay tuned for upcoming projects as I continue developing in this space!

## Projects ðŸ“‚

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

### 1. WebApp for Student Profile, Results, and Question Bank (PHP & SQLite) - **(Discontinued)**

This web-based project includes a system for managing student profiles, results, and a class-wise question bank. It allows teachers and admins to upload questions, manage students, and handle various educational tasks. The project is **discontinued** but remains a valuable learning experience for me.

**URL**: [digitalmyschool.epizy.com](http://digitalmyschool.epizy.com/)

**Tech Used**:
- **PHP**
- **SQLite**
- **HTML/CSS**

### 2. Classic Space Invader Game (Python & Pygame)

A classic implementation of the popular Space Invader game using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game is simple, fun, and fully playable.

**URL**: [Space Invader Game](https://github.com/sarwat33/SpaceInvader)

**Tech Used**:
- **Python**
- **Pygame**

### 3. IMDB Movie Scraper (Python & Requests)

A Python mini-project that scrapes the latest list of movies from the IMDB database using the **Requests** library. It stores the scraped data in a JSON file, including movie details like name, poster, cast, release date, rating, and votes.

**URL**: [Movie API Scraper](https://github.com/sarwat33/movieAPI)

**Tech Used**:
- **Python**
- **Requests**
- **JSON**

### 4. CLI TODO App (Python & OOP)

A command-line interface (CLI) based TODO app that uses **OOP** principles to manage tasks. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.

**URL**: [CLI TODO](https://github.com/sarwat33/CLI-TODO)

**Tech Used**:
- **Python**
- **OOP**
